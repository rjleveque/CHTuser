    "# New topo DEMs in Southwest WA\n",
    "## Some Observations and Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "Under development for the [Cascadia CoPes Hub](https://cascadiacopeshub.org/) project, supported by NSF.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have been investigating the new CUDEM tiles published in December, 2025 and have some questions...\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook illustrates some of the questions, and uses the list of topo sources found here:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://depts.washington.edu/ptha/CHTuser/topo/topo-sources-cascadia/\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a possibly incomplete list of places where we have found the topo DEMs for the Cascadia region. Corrections or additions welcome!\n",
    "\n",
    "In many cases the most recent tiles are available in two different forms:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A tif file referenced to NAVD88 e.g. in the catalog\n",
    "  \n",
    "  https://coast.noaa.gov/htdata/raster2/elevation/NCEI_ninth_Topobathy_2014_8483/wash_outercoast/index.html\n",
    "  \n",
    "- A netCDF file referenced to MHW (on the THREDDS server in folders for `nthmp`), e.g. in the catalog\n",
    "\n",
    "  https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/thredds/catalog/tiles/nthmp/tiled_19as/catalog.html\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of our questions pertain to the difference between these:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Why are different formats (tif/nc) used for the different versions?\n",
    "2. When reading these files, it seems that the `x,y` values in the .nc files are offset by integer multiples of $\\Delta = $ 1/9\" from integer values of longitude, latitude.  By contrast, the `x,y` in the .tif files are offset by half-integral offsets.  In the .nc files the first and last latitudes are exactly at 47.00 and 47.25, for example, whereas in the .tif files there are always a few points outside the tile with `y` values at $47 \\pm \\Delta/2$, for example.  Why are these indexed differently?\n",
    "3. Does this mean that one set of values should be viewed as pointwise values and the other as cell average values?  Running `gdalinfo` on a .tif file shows that it includes the metadata\n",
    "\n",
    "     AREA_OR_POINT=Area\n",
    "   \n",
    "   But the .nc file does not seem to have this metadata field.\n",
    "\n",
    "   The elevations `z` in the two files are not identical (even after accounting for the difference\n",
    "   from NAVD88 to MHW), so they are not the same values simply offset by $\\Delta/2$.\n",
    "   \n",
    "5. How was the conversion done from .tif to .nc?  Which of these is considered more accurate, and the one that we should use if possible?  Presumably the .tif files, which are referenced to NAVD88?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. I assume the conversion from NAVD88 to MHW was done with VDATUM?  Was this applied to the entire .tif file? (The online version seems to only allow ASCII files or single points as input. The ASCII file version does not seem to be working and the single point version doesn't return values very far inland.)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. In at least one case, `n47x00_w124x25`, the .nc file is labelled `2025v1` while the .tif file is labelled `2025v2`. Is the .nc file obsolete?  Are the differences from one version to another described anywhere?\n"
