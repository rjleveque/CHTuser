# Topography DEMs

Topography DEMs (Digital Elevation Models) at various resolutions are needed
for doing tsunami modeling.

## Sources of topo DEMs

The data used for GeoClaw modeling has mostly come from NCEI websites,
and a summary of some specific sources can be found in
[](topo_sources_cascadia).

## Derived data sets

A number of different Python scripts and notebooks have been used to create
the "topofiles" that are directly used by GeoClaw. Some of these will be
included here...

The following topofiles are available on TACC for those running GeoClaw there:
