# Ground motions

As part of the [Cascadia CoPes Hub](https://cascadiacopeshub.org/) project,
a new set of 36 ground motions have been computed using 3D simulations.
The surface deformation from these ground motions have been used as sources
for tsunami simulations.

## Summary of sources

See the [dtopo/GroundMotions.ipynb notebook](GroundMotions) for a list of
the sources and some additional information.
