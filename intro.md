# Working with CoPes Hub Tsunami data

These pages will help explain tools developed for working with tsunami
modeling data produced
by [Cascadia CoPes Hub](https://cascadiacopeshub.org/) researchers.

This Jupyter book was built using the markdown files and Jupyter notebooks
found in the Github repository [CHTuser](https://github.com/rjleveque/CHTuser).
The notebooks can serve as templates for users to explore the data in
different ways and/or adapt them to other geographic locations.

Data will generally be shared on 
[DesignSafe](https://www.designsafe-ci.org), and so these notes explain how
the notebooks can be run on a DesignSafe Jupyter Hub.  Or the workflow can be
adapted to run on a laptop or other computer if the data is downloaded.

To get started, see these pages:

- [](python_env) describes the Python environment needed to run the
  notebooks included in this repository (and rendered in this documentation).

- [](workflow) describes the workflow on DesignSafe.

- [](geoclaw_on_tacc) describes the workflow for those who want to do their
  own tsunami modeling by running the GeoClaw code on
  [TACC](https://tacc.utexas.edu/), including a summary of how to download
  results or transfer them from `stampede3` to DesignSafe for further
  processing or to share with collaborators.
